I am interested in understanding the nature of cognition and building generally intelligent agents, especially approximations of universal artificial intelligence and new architectures for deep reinforcement learning.  
  
In addition to being a researcher, I am an internet entrepreneur. Since 2006, I have founded several internet companies. I am on the board of [The Center for Media and Democracy](http://prwatch.org/). I graduated from the University of  
Washington with a degree in Applied and Computational Mathematical Sciences.
